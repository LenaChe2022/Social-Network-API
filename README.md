# Social-Network-API

## Description

Social Network API is an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends' thoughts, and create a friend list.
My motivation was to try my skills in creating a back end and to understand how to build and structure the API with No SQL database. I used Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM.
